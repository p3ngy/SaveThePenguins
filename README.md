# SaveThePenguins
Yo, hello
so basically this is my game that i made.
It was for my personal project (a very stoopid thing we had to do) and digital technology project
(two birds with one stone, im a genius, i know)

Ok, so about the game
its about climate change and how it is affecting penguins
in the game you have to stop this
the whole point is to raise awarness about climate change
but idk if that worked

anyway, many people have said it is fun
so maybe you will enjoy it too
also there is a bonus level to find
